I am Not a Developer I just wanted the abilty to run it in docker feel free to use it and use at your own risk! I'm no where near smart enough to supply support! 

Make sure you change the Environment variables in the docker compose. 

I used openssl rand -hex 16 To generate a random secret.

And here's the docs for the TMDB api key https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started












# Movie Cataloguer

A web-based movie catalogue built with **Flask** and **SQLite** that lets you manage your movie collection. It supports adding, editing, deleting, and organizing movies, integrates with **TMDb API** for movie identification, and allows importing/exporting via CSV.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/themarveled/movie-cataloguer.git
cd movie-cataloguer
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up TMDb API key (optional if you want identification)**

* You can either:

  * Open `config.py` and replace the placeholder:

```python
TMDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE"
```

* Or, if no key is set, enter it directly in the web interface after running the app (dynamic input box appears).

4. **Run the app**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Open in browser**

## Dependencies

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
* [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/)
* SQLite (built-in with Python)

---

## Configuration (`config.py`)

* **TMDb API Key**: Required for identifying movies and fetching posters. Can be set in the file or via the web UI.
* **Database Path**: `DB_PATH = "movies.db"` (default location of SQLite database).
* **Page Size**: Number of movies per page (`PAGE_SIZE = 78` default).
* **Flask Secret Key**: `SECRET_KEY` for session security.
* **Default Movie Status**: `DEFAULT_STATUS = "owned"`
* **Default Movie Format**: `DEFAULT_FORMAT = "Blu-ray"`
* **CSV Export Filename**: `CSV_EXPORT_FILENAME = "movies_export.csv"`
* **TMDb Poster Size**: `TMDB_POSTER_SIZE = "w200"`
* **Debug Mode**: `DEBUG = True`

You can customize all these settings in `config.py` to personalize your app.

## Notes

* If **TMDb API key is not set**, movie identification features will be disabled.
* CSV import requires headers: `barcode,title,year,format,poster_path,status`.
* The dynamic key input allows setting the API key **without editing code manually**, but you must **restart the app** for changes to take effect.
* Inside the movie_catalogue folder is a file **movies_export.csv**. You can use this to demo the catalogue by importing it via the import button in the footer. This is my own personal collection, so enjoy.

## Why did I make this?

I’ve been looking for a good way to catalogue my physical movie collection for years, but everything I found was locked behind **subscriptions**, **artificial limits**, or was simply **clunky to use**. Most importantly, none of them were **open source**.

If I want to change how a piece of software works, I want to be able to do that — not wait for an update or pay for a feature.

So I built **Movie Cataloguer** to be:

* **Fully open source**
* **Completely self-hosted**
* **Highly customisable**
* **Free to use, forever**

To get you started quickly, the app includes **TMDb API integration** for automatic movie identification, **fast backend processing** with Flask and SQLite, and a **clean, visual UI** designed specifically for browsing physical media collections.
However I do appreciate a donation to help maintain this project.
